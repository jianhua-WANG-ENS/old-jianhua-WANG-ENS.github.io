## Journey to Becoming a Volunteer
In Feburary 2023, I committed to becoming a volunteer for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games and initiated the official registration process. This marked the beginning of an exciting journey toward contributing to one of the world's most prestigious sporting events.

### Selection and Preparation
#### Interview and Selection
On August 1st, 2023, I successfully completed an interview with the team responsible for the Sport Climbing venue at Le Bourget. Following this, on September 20th, 2023, I officially received an offer to join the Sport Information team as a volunteer at the Sport Climbing competition site.

#### Volunteer Convention and Training
After attending the Volunteer Convention on March 23rd, 2024, I was eager to begin my role. This phase included receiving my accreditation and uniform, participating in several online meetings with the Sport Climbing organization team, and undergoing on-site training to familiarize myself with the competition area.

### Understanding Sport Climbing at the Olympics
Sport climbing made its Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020, and Paris 2024 marks only the second time it will be featured. Unlike Tokyo, where speed, bouldering, and lead climbing were combined into a single event, Paris 2024 introduces separate competitions for speed and for the combined bouldering and lead events. This change necessitated significant preparation before the competition begins on August 5th, 2024.

### Volunteer Responsibilities
#### Pre-Competition Week
I began my volunteer duties on July 28th. The week leading up to the competition was dedicated to on-site training for athletes and getting acquainted with the competition venue. This period was crucial for ensuring everything was ready for the event.

#### Supporting Athletes and Coaches
My primary responsibilities included welcoming and assisting athletes and coaches in the training gymnasium and isolation areas during the official competition. This role was essential in providing the support needed for a smooth and successful event.

#### Translation for Chinese Team
In addition to my assigned duties, I took on the role of unofficial translator for the Chinese Sport Climbing team, with permission from my team leader. I accompanied the coach into the final call room, located behind the competition wall, to assist with communication.

During the men's speed climbing quarterfinals, as the Chinese athlete Wu Peng prepared to compete against the USA team, the officials in the final call room remarked, "Perhaps Team China can win a medal." To everyone's surprise, including the coach's, Wu Peng defeated his American opponent and advanced to the final against Indonesia. In a thrilling race, Wu Peng won the silver medal, finishing just 0.02 seconds behind the winner.

Before the victory ceremony, I translated and explained the details to Wu Peng, ensuring he understood the procedure. I also guided him through the anti-doping control process afterward.

### Lessons from the Olympic Experience
Volunteering at the Olympic Games allowed me to experience nearly every aspect of organizing a major sporting event. I learned that no event is ever perfect, and there will always be unexpected challenges and small incidents. However, two key aspects stand out:

1. Ensuring Fair Competition: It is critical to maintain the integrity of the competition by using precise and reliable instruments. This is especially true for speed climbing, which is akin to a vertical 100-meter sprint, where the accuracy of timing equipment is paramount.

2. Providing Exceptional Service to Athletes: Ensuring the safety and well-being of athletes and coaches is essential. High-level athletes are akin to celebrities and require careful attention.

Much like life, where we juggle different priorities at various stages, organizing such an event requires focus on the core objectives while managing other aspects as best as possible. The experience reinforced the importance of prioritizing and dedicating energy to the tasks that truly matter.
