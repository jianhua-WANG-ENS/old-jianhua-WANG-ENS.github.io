üìÖJul. - Aug. 2022 & Jul. - Aug. 2023

During July and August of 2022 and 2023, I embarked on a rewarding WWOOFing journey at a family vineyard. This experience offered deep insights into both agricultural practices and local culture. My main responsibilities included:


#### Early Morning Grape Harvesting
- I participated in hand-harvesting grapes, starting at 5 am each day. This hands-on involvement allowed me to truly appreciate the dedication and hard work required in vineyard operations.

#### Efficient Grape Processing
- Following the harvest, we swiftly processed the grapes, transforming them into pre-fermented juice within just 3 hours. This task emphasized the importance of timing and collaboration in maintaining the quality of the produce.

#### Maintaining Hygiene with Crate Cleaning
- A key part of my role involved ensuring the cleanliness of the crates used for grape transportation. This meticulous attention to hygiene was crucial for preserving the integrity of the grape processing.

#### Cultural and Culinary Exploration
- Outside of vineyard duties, I had the chance to explore local culture through food. I cooked traditional Chinese dishes while also indulging in authentic French cuisine, enriching my understanding of both cultures.

#### Balancing Work with Leisure
- During my free time, I explored the local area, engaging in activities like ocean surfing, rock climbing, playing Petanque, and enjoying seafood barbecues. These experiences allowed me to relax and connect with nature and the community.
